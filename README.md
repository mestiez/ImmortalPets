Every tamed animal becomes immune to all damage, making them immortal. The only exception is the `/kill` command, but nobody is that cruel.

I made this mod because I've always been reluctant to tame animals in Minecraft in fear of losing them. I know they're not real but it still feels bad. Now they are invincible.
